# Data at the heart of modern Genomics
## Introduction
We hear about precision medicine, genes playing a role in customizing patient care. Data scientists, data analysts and even data engineers are presented today with molecular data in the **FASTQ, BAM, VCF** format. There is a flood of molecular data, which as a data professional you are expected to analyze. But what exactly are these file formats? How are they generated? What are the data sources? What types of analysis and insights are possible with them? 

These were some of the questions I struggled with which made it difficult to understand what I was dealing with. At the end of the day, it's all bits and bytes, its csv, tsv files, so why not just use python or R and work through the data? Shouldn’t it be that simple? 

Well sadly no. Understanding the biological domain is necessary to make meaningful headway into the data, its interpretation, and the insights you draw. This struggle motivated me to dig deeper, simplify the domain and write up on cell biology for the engineer.
