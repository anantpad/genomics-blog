All samples are sent to the Histopathology Lab, where each receives an accession number and barcode. In the lab, the sample is further processed and observations noted. The barcode is carried on to any plastic cassettes, slides that may arise from the specimen. The sample undergoes gross (macroscopic) examination followed by processing into FFPE blocks. These blocks are sectioned, mounted on slides, stained, and barcoded for microscopic examination.

    #### Macroscopic Examination
    First a macroscopic (gross) observation (size, color, etc.) by the pathologist. 
    #### Microscopic Examination
    Also the specimen is oriented for final slides and kept in plastic cassettes. These cassettes already have areas for patient and specimen information to be printed or etched on them, and crucially, they are usually barcoded.
    Next the tissue is processed in the lab (dehydrated using a tissue processor, cleared, embedded in paraffin wax) for paraffin block (FFPE block) creation. FFPE paraffin blocks are meticulously identified with barcodes.
    A microtome is used to section the paraffin block, mount on a slide, stain and add a coverslip on the stained section - making it ready for microscopic examination. These glass slides are also barcoded with the same unique accession number and other relevant identifiers.
    Not all of the paraffin block is consumed for sectioning, as the block may be needed for molecular analysis as well. The virtual slide is stored in a digital file format, often a proprietary format specific to the scanner manufacturer, but can also be in more open formats like TIFF or SVS.

#### Pathology Report
The pathologist examines the stained slides and creates a pathology report based on macroscopic and microscopic findings.
This report is stored in the EMR as free text and may include images. A diagnostic report record in the EMR has the reference to the patient identifier, the accession number, the sample identifier, date of the report and the free-text report that includes macro and microscopic exam observations. In some cases, the report is a paper based report that is scanned and uploaded, and in some cases a digital version of the text may be available as well.
